# Task 005: Trailer MPPI Under Model Mismatch

## Purpose

Task 4 introduced a higher-fidelity Fiala tire model, a trailer, black-ice patches, and the distinction between actual simulation dynamics and MPPI rollout dynamics. Task 5 focuses on that distinction more carefully.

In Task 4, one setting allowed the controller to update its internal rollout friction as soon as the vehicle stepped onto ice. This is useful, but it is still optimistic. In a real system, the controller may not immediately know the correct friction, and the model used inside MPPI may be much simpler than the true system.

For this task, use the trailer setting from Task 4. Car-only experiments can be skipped. The goal is to compare controller performance when the actual simulator remains high fidelity, but the model used inside MPPI is wrong in two different ways:

1. The rollout dynamics keep nominal friction even after the actual vehicle drives onto ice.
2. The rollout dynamics use a reduced-order kinematic tractor-trailer model instead of the Fiala trailer model.

The important idea is:

```text
actual simulator step function != MPPI rollout dynamics
```

The actual simulator must always use the true local friction and the higher-fidelity trailer dynamics. Only the model used by MPPI for sampled rollouts changes between experiments.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this task, you should be able to:

- Separate actual simulation dynamics from controller rollout dynamics.
- Evaluate how model mismatch affects MPPI and Smooth MPPI.
- Compare high-fidelity trailer rollouts against reduced-order kinematic rollouts.
- Explain why unknown friction and simplified dynamics degrade closed-loop control.
- Design experiments that isolate one modeling assumption at a time.
- Report success rates and failure modes across target speeds and driving directions.
- Connect model mismatch to future residual dynamics learning and adaptation.

## Technical Requirements

Your implementation should include:

- A trailer-only experiment setup based on Task 4.
- A clear way to choose the rollout model used by MPPI and Smooth MPPI.
- An actual simulator step function that always uses the true local friction.
- An unknown-friction rollout mode where MPPI always uses nominal friction, such as `mu = 1.0`.
- A reduced-order kinematic tractor-trailer rollout model.
- Forward and backward speed sweeps.
- Results tables comparing MPPI, Smooth MPPI, rollout model, direction, and target speed.
- A short experiment README explaining how to run the task.
- Answers to the written questions.

## Subtask 1: Unknown Friction in the Rollout Model

Repeat the Task 4 trailer ice experiment, but do not update the friction inside MPPI rollouts.

The actual simulator should still behave realistically:

- If the car COM is on ice, the car tire friction should drop.
- If the trailer COM is on ice, the trailer tire friction should drop.
- If the car and trailer are on different surfaces, handle that case explicitly and document the choice.

The controller should not know this friction change:

- MPPI rollout dynamics should keep nominal friction.
- Smooth MPPI rollout dynamics should keep nominal friction.
- Do not update rollout friction when the vehicle enters ice.
- Do not preview ice patches from the renderer or map.

Compare this setting against the Task 4 setting where the rollout friction was updated after contact.

Run:

- Forward driving.
- Backward driving.
- Multiple target speeds.
- MPPI.
- Smooth MPPI.

For each target speed, report whether performance degrades compared with the Task 4 online-friction baseline.

## Subtask 2: Kinematic Tractor-Trailer Rollout Model

Now keep the same high-fidelity actual simulator, but replace the MPPI rollout dynamics with a simple kinematic tractor-trailer model.

Use acceleration and steering as the control input, keeping the same control interface used by the Task 4 trailer controller.

The rollout state should be:

```text
x, y, theta_1, theta_2, v
```

where:

- `x, y` are the tractor position.
- `theta_1` is the tractor yaw.
- `theta_2` is the trailer yaw.
- `v` is the longitudinal speed.

The input should be:

```text
steering, acceleration
```

The kinematic rollout model should not include:

- Tire forces.
- Fiala tire saturation.
- Lateral slip angle.
- Yaw-rate dynamics.
- Explicit friction coefficient.

This gives a reduced-order model inside the controller while the actual simulator remains high fidelity. The purpose is to measure how much control performance degrades when MPPI plans with a simplified model.

Run the same forward and backward speed sweeps as Subtask 1.

## Controller Parameter Reuse

This task should not require a new controller tuning effort.

Use the best MPPI and Smooth MPPI parameters you found in Task 4 as the default controller settings. The main point of Task 5 is to isolate model mismatch, not to re-optimize the controller for every mismatch case.

In the PR, report:

- Which Task 4 run or configuration your parameters came from.
- The reused horizon, sample count, temperature, noise covariance, smoothness settings, cost weights, and control limits.
- Whether any small parameter change was necessary to make the experiment run.
- Why you made that change, if any.

Do not run a new tuning sweep for this task. The required comparison should use the Task 4 parameters as much as possible.

## Result Tables

Create tables that make the comparison easy to read.

At minimum, include:

- Controller.
- Rollout model.
- Actual simulator model.
- Driving direction.
- Target speed.
- Number of trials.
- Success rate.
- Average speed.
- Average slip angle.
- Average yaw rate.
- Average hitch angle.
- First failed ice patch, if applicable.
- Notes on failure mode.

Recommended rollout model labels:

```text
Fiala trailer, online friction update
Fiala trailer, nominal friction only
Kinematic trailer
```
